In this file are some examples of code I wrote

"NeuroProjectJavaFiles" contains a number of files used to group data on the reaction time of animals.
Essentially, there were a number of excel files with a specific layout which had to be read and combined to make one large data set.
The animals were run though a Go-No Go behavior task with two groups, one aged and another young. 
There were two groups (Age) and two types of trials the animals could undergo, either a Go trial or a No Go trial. 
We wanted to know if the previous trial type (Go or No Go) had an effect on the reaction time of the animal's response to the task,
as well as how age had an effect on this. 
So, the program output a .csv file with a data set that had five columns: 
  ID, Current Trial type, Previous Trial type, Age, and Reaction Time
With this, we made a number of graphs, including histograms and box and whisker plots to see the differences in distributions.
We ran a MANOVA, similar to the one shown in the R file in the next example of my code.
I used an Apache library to communicate with excel here, and I can't share the excel docs because the data is unpublished research,
which means it is difficult to run this file on your computer, but I can show you what in person if that is appropriate.

"MultAnova.r" contains a skeleton of a ANOVA done in R with explainations on how to write it. 
I shared this with other people in Temple's neuroscience department interested in running statistics in R as well as using it in my own project.

"barGraphBasicLayout.py" contains a skeleton of a bar graph with instructions on how to use it.
I shared this with some graduate students who where interested in using matplotlib in python to graph.

"Snake" contains a version of the game Snake that I wrote that shows understanding of both object orriented programming and event based programming.
It uses a library called Simple GUI written by a professor at Temple University.
