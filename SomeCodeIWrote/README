In this file are some examples of code I wrote

"NeuroProjectJavaFiles" contains a number of files used to group data on the reaction time of animals.
Essentially, there were a number of excel files with a specific layout which had to be read and combined to make one large data set.
The animals were run though a Go-No Go behavior task with two groups, one aged and another young. 
There were two groups and two types of trials the animals could undergo, either a Go trial or a No Go trial. 
We wanted to know if the previous trial type (Go or No Go) had an effect on the reaction time of the animal's response to the task,
as well as how age had an effect on this. 
So, the data set had four columns: Current Trial type, Previous Trial type, Age, and Reaction Time
With this, we ran a MANOVA, as shown in the R file in the next example of my code.

"MultAnova.r" contains a skeleton of a ANOVA done in R with explainations on how to write it. 
I shared this with other people in Temple's neuroscience department interested in running statistics in R as well as using it in my own project.

"barGraphBasicLayout.py" contains a skeleton of a bar graph with instructions on how to use it.
I shared this with some graduate students who where interested in using matplotlib in python to graph.
